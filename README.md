# Poultry-keeping-support
This mobile app was developed by me together with my group mates of Google developers group Makerere Uganda. 
This application teaches and aids people (farmers) with no knowledge of keeping and rearing poultry. 
This application tells and remands the user (farmer) when to give feds (type of feds and quantity), vaccinate (type of medicine) 
and also keeping records for future use and references.
